This is the second time! This time I made it from scratch. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Cardio&amp;rdquo;, because it has a paper layout. Also because it&amp;rsquo;s trimmed of fat.
Why new theme, and why not use a pre-existing one? I wanted to learn Hugo some more, since I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely interested in the Hugo CMS. What better way than to make a Hugo theme? I was also not satisfied with the old theme.</description></item><item><title>New Theme!</title><link>//odyssey346.dev/posts/newtheme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 16:24:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>//odyssey346.dev/posts/newtheme/</guid><description>New Theme for the blog! I was happy with the old theme but I like the Hello Friend theme. I liked the layout, but the theme, was ehh.. So I forked it! So the current theme have my changes. Light mode is a bit scuffed at the moment, but hey, it works.
Thoughts? Well, there is a comment section right under here. Post your thoughts about the theme there, and any bugs/inconsistencies you find in it :)</description></item></channel></rss>
