# So yes, I switched themes again.
This is the second time! This time I made it from scratch. It's called "Cardio", because it has a paper layout. Also because it's trimmed of fat.

## Why new theme, and why not use a pre-existing one?
I wanted to learn Hugo some more, since I'm genuinely interested in the Hugo CMS. What better way than to make a Hugo theme? I was also not satisfied with the old theme.

## As always, I'm open to feedback.
If you have any feedback, please leave it in the comments below. I'm open to any feedback, positive or negative.
