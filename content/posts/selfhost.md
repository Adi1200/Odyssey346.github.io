## Privacy and bandwidth are important.
This is true. All those services like YouTube load an insane amount of bloat in your browser. All you want to do is watch a YouTube video? Enjoy like 10MB of JS, HTML, tracking etc. You agree that sucks, right? Well, you have [Invidious](https://invidious.io) and [Piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/piped), which let you watch YouTube videos, without all the tracking and bloat. Same applies to Reddit, which has a privacy frontend called Libreddit. Bibliogram, Nitter, oh I can go on for days with this..

## Ok, here's what you've been waiting for

I recently got a VPS from a friend of mine's friend. Awesome. I have decided I have nothing to host on it yet, so I will host some privacy services.

You can find an up-to-date list of what I host and some details about this VPS at [pol.odyssey346.dev](https://pol.odyssey346.dev). But, here's what I host for now:

- [Libreddit](https://lr.odyssey346.dev)
- [Invidious](https://inv.odyssey346.dev)
- [ProxiTok](https://proxitok.odyssey346.dev)
- [Quetre](https://quetre.odyssey346.dev)

If you want the privacy policy, please wait a day or two as I need to write it first.

(remind me to if I don't!)
