# New Theme for the blog!
I was happy with the old theme but I like the Hello Friend theme. I liked the layout, but the theme, was ehh.. So I forked it! So the current theme have my changes. Light mode is a bit scuffed at the moment, but hey, it works.

## Thoughts?
Well, there is a comment section right under here. Post your thoughts about the theme there, and any bugs/inconsistencies you find in it :)
