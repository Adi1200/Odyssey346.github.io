So&amp;hellip; why? # I was checking out my ThinkPad, and I was trying to run Minecraft on it. To my surprise, apparently it did not support OpenGL! But, it does support OpenGL&amp;hellip; what&amp;rsquo;s going on?
Let&amp;rsquo;s blame Intel # Intel&amp;rsquo;s graphic drivers were, obviously, legacy. This is a laptop from 2012. The drivers weren&amp;rsquo;t intended to run on Windows 10, but it does&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s where it messes up though: Windows 10 and newer change the NT kernel version from 6 to 10.</description></item><item><title>New Theme!</title><link>//odyssey346.dev/posts/newtheme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 16:24:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>//odyssey346.dev/posts/newtheme/</guid><description>

My experience getting my information off of the Internet # Recently I decided to learn about tools you can use to stalk find out information about Internet users, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using them to find information I&amp;rsquo;ve published about myself on the internet that I really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. So, in this post I will show off the tools I used and my technique to finding information about myself that I&amp;rsquo;ve published on the internet, and find old accounts, so that you can stay safe on the internet.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>//odyssey346.dev/posts/helloworld/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 15:07:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>//odyssey346.dev/posts/helloworld/</guid><description>

Well, who am I # I&amp;rsquo;m a 14 year old Norwegian computer nerd who enjoys tinkering with code and software. I also like playing games. I sound really generic, don&amp;rsquo;t I? Maybe cause I am.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of my personality, in audio format:
Seems like playing audio isn't supported in your browser. What I&amp;rsquo;ve done and made # I&amp;rsquo;ve:
been in 3 organizations dabbling with computers. (Terrific Tea Studios, Neutron Technologies, Project Segfault) made a tool called Fixdows lived for 14 years (amazing accomplishment) Probably some more things I forgot.</description></item><item><title>My email</title><link>//odyssey346.dev/mail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//odyssey346.dev/mail/</guid><description>
